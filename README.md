> üèÄ Analyze basketball shots with machine learning!

This is an artificial intelligence application built on the concept of **object detection**. Analyze basketball shots by digging into the data collected from object detection. We can get the result by simply uploading files to the web App, or submitting a **POST request** to the API. Please check the [features](#features) below.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Get a copy

Get a copy of this project by simply running the git clone command.

``` git
git clone https://github.com/chonyy/AI-basketball-analysis.git
```

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, we have to install all the dependencies from requirements.txt

``` pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Hosting

Last, get the project hosted on your local machine with a single command.

``` python
python app.py
```

#### Alternatives

This project is also hosted on [Heroku](https://ai-basketball-analysis.herokuapp.com/). However, the heavy computation of TensorFlow may cause Timeout error and crash the app. Therefore, hosting the project on your local machine is more preferable.

## Features

This project has three main features, [shot analysis](shot-analysis), [shot detection](shot-detection), [detection API](detection-api).

### Shot analysis

<p align=center>
    <img src="./static/img/analysis_result.PNG">
</p>

Counting shooting attempts and missing, scoring shots from the input video.
Detection keypoints in different colors have different meanings listed below:
* **Blue:** Detected basketball in normal status
* **Purple**: Undetermined shot
* **Green:** Shot went in
* **Red:** Miss


### Shot detection

<p align=center>
    <img src="./static/img/detection.PNG">
</p>

Detection will be shown on the image. The confidence and the coordinate of the detection will be listed below.

### Detection API

<p align=center>
    <img src="./static/img/API.PNG" width="861.6" height="649.6">
</p>

Get the JSON response by submitting a **POST** request to (./detection_json) with "image" as KEY and input image as VALUE.

## Detection model

</p>

The object detection model is trained with the [Faster R-CNN model architecture](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md#coco-trained-models), which includes pretrained weight on COCO dataset. Taking the configuration from the model architecture and train it on my own dataset.


## Future plans
1. Host it on azure web app service.
2. Improve the efficiency, making it executable on web app services.
